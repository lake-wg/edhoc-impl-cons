1.  Introduction

   Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) [RFC9528] is a lightweight
   authenticated key exchange protocol, especially intended for use in
   constrained scenarios.

   During the development of EDHOC, a number of side topics were raised
   and discussed, as emerging from reviews of the protocol latest design
   and from implementation activities.  These topics were identified as
   strongly pertaining to the implementation of EDHOC rather than to the
   protocol in itself.  Hence, they are not discussed in [RFC9528],
   which rightly focuses on specifying the actual protocol.

   At the same time, implementors of an application using the EDHOC
   protocol or of an "EDHOC library" enabling its use cannot simply
   ignore such topics, and will have to take them into account
   throughout their implementation work.

   In order to prevent multiple, independent re-discoveries and
   assessments of those topics, as well as to facilitate and guide
   implementation activities, this document collects such topics and
   discusses them through considerations about the implementation of
   EDHOC.  At a high-level, the topics in question are summarized below.

   *  Handling of completed EDHOC sessions when they become invalid, and
      of application keys derived from an EDHOC session when those
      become invalid.  This topic is discussed in Section 2.

   *  Enforcement of different trust policies, with respect to learning
      new authentication credentials during an execution of EDHOC.  This
      topic is discussed in Section 3.

   *  Branched-off, side processing of incoming EDHOC messages, with
      particular reference to: i) fetching and validation of
      authentication credentials; and ii) processing of External
      Authorization Data (EAD) items, which in turn might play a role in
      the fetching and validation of authentication credentials.  This
      topic is discussed in Section 4.

   *  Effectively using EDHOC over the Constrained Application Protocol
      (CoAP) [RFC7252] in combination with Block-wise transfers for CoAP
      [RFC7959], possibly together with the optimized EDHOC execution
      workflow defined in [RFC9668].  This topic is discussed in
      Section 5.

1.1.  Terminology

   The reader is expected to be familiar with terms and concepts related
   to the EDHOC protocol [RFC9528], the Constrained Application Protocol
   (CoAP) [RFC7252], and Block-wise transfers for CoAP [RFC7959].

2.  Handling of Invalid EDHOC Sessions and Application Keys

   This section considers the most common situation where, given a
   certain peer, only the application at that peer has visibility and
   control of both:

   *  The EDHOC sessions at that peer; and

   *  The application keys for that application at that peer, including
      the knowledge of whether they have been derived from an EDHOC
      session, i.e., by means of the EDHOC_Exporter interface after the
      successful completion of an execution of EDHOC (see Section 4.2 of
      [RFC9528]).

   Building on the above, the following expands on three relevant cases
   concerning the handling of EDHOC sessions and application keys, in
   the event that any of those becomes invalid.

   As a case in point to provide more concrete guidance, the following
   also considers the specific case where "applications keys" stands for
   the keying material and parameters that compose an OSCORE Security
   Context [RFC8613] and that are derived from an EDHOC session (see
   Appendix A.1 of [RFC9528]).

   Nevertheless, the same considerations are applicable in case EDHOC is
   used to derive other application keys, e.g., when used to key
   different security protocols than OSCORE or to provide the
   application with secure values bound to an EDHOC session.

2.1.  EDHOC Sessions Become Invalid

   The application at a peer P may have learned that a completed EDHOC
   session S has to be invalidated.  When S is marked as invalid, the
   application at P purges S and deletes each set of application keys
   (e.g., the OSCORE Security Context) that was generated from S.

   Then, the application runs a new execution of the EDHOC protocol with
   the other peer.  Upon successfully completing the EDHOC execution,
   the two peers derive and install a new set of application keys from
   this latest EDHOC session.

   The flowchart in Figure 1 shows the handling of an EDHOC session that
   has become invalid.

   Invalid     Delete the EDHOC session      Rerun     Derive and
   EDHOC   --> and the application keys  --> EDHOC --> install new
   session     derived from it                         application keys

       Figure 1: Handling of an EDHOC Session that Has Become Invalid

   An EDHOC session may have become invalid, for example, because an
   authentication credential CRED_X may have expired, or because the
   peer P may have learned from a trusted source that CRED_X has been
   revoked.  This effectively invalidates CRED_X, and therefore also
   invalidates any EDHOC session where CRED_X was used as authentication
   credential of either peer in the session (i.e., P itself or the other
   peer).  In such a case, the application at P has to additionally
   delete CRED_X and any stored, corresponding credential identifier.

2.2.  Application Keys Become Invalid

   The application at a peer P may have learned that a set of
   application keys is not safe to use anymore.  When such a set is
   specifically an OSCORE Security Context, the application may have
   learned that from the used OSCORE library or from an OSCORE layer
   that takes part to the communication stack.

   A current set SET of application keys shared with another peer can
   become unsafe to use, for example, due to the following reasons.

   *  SET has reached a pre-determined expiration time; or

   *  SET has been established to use for a now elapsed amount of time,
      according to enforced application policies; or

   *  Some elements of SET have been used enough times to approach
      cryptographic limits that should not be passed, e.g., according to
      the properties of the security algorithms specifically used.  With
      particular reference to an OSCORE Security Context, such limits
      are discussed in [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-limits].

   When this happens, the application at the peer P proceeds as follows.

   1.  If the following conditions both hold, then the application moves
       to Step 2.  Otherwise, it moves to Step 3.

       *  Let us define S as the EDHOC session from which the peer P has
          derived SET or the eldest SET's ancestor set of application
          keys.  Then, since the completion of S with the other peer,
          the application at P has received from the other peer at least
          one message protected with any set of application keys derived
          from S.  That is, P has persisted S (see Section 5.4.2 of
          [RFC9528]).

       *  The peer P supports a key update protocol, as an alternative
          to performing a new execution of EDHOC with the other peer.
          When SET is an OSCORE Security Context, the key update
          protocol supported by the peer P can be KUDOS
          [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update].

   2.  The application at P runs the key update protocol mentioned at
       Step 1 with the other peer, in order to update SET.  When SET is
       an OSCORE Security Context, the application at P can run the key
       update protocol KUDOS with the other peer.

       If the key update protocol terminates successfully, the updated
       application keys are installed and no further actions are taken.
       Otherwise, the application at P moves to Step 3.

   3.  The application at the peer P performs the following actions.

       *  It deletes SET.

       *  It deletes the EDHOC session from which SET was generated, or
          from which the eldest SET's ancestor set of application keys
          was generated before any key update occurred (e.g., by means
          of the EDHOC_KeyUpdate interface defined in Appendix H of
          [RFC9528] or other key update methods).

       *  It runs a new execution of the EDHOC protocol with the other
          peer.  Upon successfully completing the EDHOC execution, the
          two peers derive and install a new set of application keys
          from this latest EDHOC session.

   The flowchart in Figure 2 shows the handling of a set of application
   keys that has become invalid.  In particular, it assumes such a set
   to be an OSCORE Security Context and the key update protocol to be
   KUDOS.

2.3.  Application Keys or Bound Access Rights Become Invalid

   The following considers two peers that use the ACE framework for
   authentication and authorization in constrained environments
   [RFC9200], and specifically the EDHOC and OSCORE profile of ACE
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile].

   When doing so, one of the two peers acts as ACE resource server (RS)
   hosting protected resources.  The other peer acts as ACE client and
   requests from an ACE authorization server (AS) an access token, which
   specifies access rights for accessing protected resources at the RS
   as well as the public authentication credential of the client, namely
   AUTH_CRED_C.

   After that, C uploads the access token to the RS, by means of an EAD
   item included in an EDHOC message during the EDHOC execution (see
   below).  Alternatively, the AS can upload the access token to the RS
   on behalf of the client, as per the alternative workflow defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ace-workflow-and-params].

   Consistent with the used EDHOC and OSCORE profile of ACE, the two
   peers run EDHOC in order to specifically derive an OSCORE Security
   Context as their shared set of application keys (see Appendix A.1 of
   [RFC9528]).  At the RS, the access token is bound to the successfully
   completed EDHOC session and the established OSCORE Security Context.

   After that, the peer acting as ACE client can access the protected
   resources hosted at the other peer acting as RS, according to the
   access rights specified in the access token.  The communications
   between the two peers are protected by means of the established
   OSCORE Security Context.

   Later on, the application at one of the two peers P may have learned
   that the established OSCORE Security Context CTX is not safe to use
   anymore, e.g., from the used OSCORE library or from an OSCORE layer
   that takes part to the communication stack.  The reasons that make
   CTX not safe to use anymore are the same ones discussed in
   Section 2.2 when considering a set of application keys in general,
   plus the event where the access token bound to CTX becomes invalid
   (e.g., it has expired or it has been revoked).

   When this happens, the application at the peer P proceeds as follows.

   1.  If the following conditions both hold, then the application moves
       to Step 2.  Otherwise, it moves to Step 3.

       *  The access token is still valid.  That is, it has not expired
          yet and the peer P is not aware that it has been revoked.

       *  Let us define S as the EDHOC session from which the peer P has
          derived CTX or the eldest CTX's ancestor OSCORE Security
          Context.  Then, since the completion of S with the other peer,
          the application at P has received from the other peer at least
          one message protected with any set of application keys derived
          from S.  That is, P has persisted S (see Section 5.4.2 of
          [RFC9528]).

   2.  If the peer P supports the key update protocol KUDOS
       [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update], then P runs KUDOS with the
       other peer, in order to update CTX.  If the execution of KUDOS
       terminates successfully, the updated OSCORE Security Context is
       installed and no further actions are taken.

       If the execution of KUDOS does not terminate successfully or if
       the peer P does not support KUDOS altogether, then the
       application at P moves to Step 3.

   3.  The application at the peer P performs the following actions.

       *  If the access token is not valid anymore, the peer P deletes
          all the EDHOC sessions associated with the access token, as
          well as the OSCORE Security Context derived from each of those
          sessions.

          Note that, when specifically considering the EDHOC and OSCORE
          profile of ACE, an access token is associated with at most one
          EDHOC session (see Section 4.2 of
          [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile]).

          If the peer P acted as ACE client, then P obtains from the ACE
          AS a new access token, which is uploaded to the other peer
          acting as ACE RS.

          Finally, the application at P moves to Step 4.

       *  If the access token is valid while the OSCORE Security Context
          CTX is not, then the peer P deletes CTX.

          After that, the peer P deletes the EDHOC session from which
          CTX was generated, or from which the eldest CTX's ancestor
          OSCORE Security Context was generated before any key update
          occurred (e.g., by means of KUDOS or other key update
          methods).

          Finally, the application at P moves to Step 4.

   4.  The peer P runs a new execution of the EDHOC protocol with the
       other peer.  Upon successfully completing the EDHOC execution,
       the two peers derive and install a new OSCORE Security Context
       from this latest EDHOC session.

       At the RS, the access token is bound to this latest EDHOC session
       and the newly established OSCORE Security Context.

   The flowchart in Figure 3 shows the handling of an access token or of
   a set of application keys that have become invalid, when using the
   EDHOC and OSCORE profile of the ACE framework.

3.  Trust Policies for Learning New Authentication Credentials

   A peer P relies on authentication credentials of other peers, in
   order to authenticate those peers when running EDHOC with them.

   There are different ways for P to acquire an authentication
   credential CRED of another peer.  For example, CRED can be supplied
   to P out-of-band by a trusted provider.

   Alternatively, CRED can be specified by the other peer during the
   EDHOC execution with P.  This can rely on EDHOC message_2 or
   message_3, whose respective ID_CRED_R and ID_CRED_I field can specify
   CRED by value, or instead a URI or other external reference where
   CRED can be retrieved from (see Section 3.5.3 of [RFC9528]).

   Also during the EDHOC execution, an External Authorization Data (EAD)
   field might include an EAD item that specifies CRED by value or
   reference.  This is the case, e.g., for the EAD items defined by the
   EDHOC and OSCORE profile of the ACE framework
   [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile].  In particular, they can be used
   for transporting (a reference to) an access token, which in turn
   specifies by value or by reference the public authentication
   credential of the EDHOC peer acting as ACE client.

   When obtaining a new credential CRED, the peer P has to validate it
   before storing it.  The validation steps to perform depend on the
   specific type of CRED (e.g., a public key certificate
   [RFC5280][I-D.ietf-cose-cbor-encoded-cert]), and can rely on (the
   authentication credential of) a trusted third party acting as a trust
   anchor.

   Upon retrieving a new CRED through the processing of a received EDHOC
   message and following the successful validation of CRED, the peer P
   stores CRED only if it assesses CRED to also be trusted, and must not
   store CRED otherwise.

   An exception applies for the two unauthenticated operations described
   in Appendix D.5 of [RFC9528], where a trust relationship with an
   unknown or not-yet-trusted endpoint is established later.  In such a
   case, CRED is verified out-of-band at a later stage, or an EDHOC
   session key is bound to an identity out-of-band at a later stage.

   When processing a received EDHOC message M that specifies an
   authentication credential CRED, the peer P can enforce one of the
   trust policies LEARNING and NO-LEARNING specified in Section 3.1 and
   Section 3.2, in order to determine whether to trust CRED.

   Irrespective of the adopted trust policy, P actually uses CRED only
   if it is determined to be fine to use in the context of the ongoing
   EDHOC session, also depending on the specific identity of the other
   peer (see Sections 3.5 and D.2 of [RFC9528]).  If this is not the
   case, P aborts the EDHOC session with the other peer.

   If P stores CRED, then P will consider CRED as valid and trusted
   until it possibly becomes invalid, e.g., because it expires or
   because P gains knowledge that it has been revoked.

   When storing CRED, the peer P should generate the authentication
   credential identifier(s) corresponding to CRED and store them as
   associated with CRED.  For example, if CRED is a public key
   certificate, an identifier of CRED can be the hash of the
   certificate.  In general, P should generate and associate with CRED
   one corresponding identifier for each type of authentication
   credential identifier that P supports and that is compatible with
   CRED.

   In future executions of EDHOC with the other peer associated with
   CRED, this allows such other peer to specify CRED by reference, e.g.,
   by indicating its credential identifier as ID_CRED_R/ID_CRED_I in the
   EDHOC message_2 or message_3 addressed to the peer P.  In turn, this
   allows P to retrieve CRED from its local storage.

3.1.  Trust Policy LEARNING

   When enforcing the LEARNING policy, the peer P trusts CRED even if P
   is not already storing CRED at message reception time.

   That is, upon receiving M, the peer P performs the following steps.

   1.  P retrieves CRED, as specified by reference or by value in the
       ID_CRED_I/ID_CRED_R field of M or in the value of an EAD item of
       M.

   2.  P checks whether CRED is already being stored and if it is still
       valid.  In such a case, P trusts CRED and can continue the EDHOC
       execution.  Otherwise, P moves to Step 3.

   3.  P attempts to validate CRED.  If the validation process is not
       successful, P aborts the EDHOC session with the other peer.
       Otherwise, P trusts and stores CRED, and can continue the EDHOC
       execution.

3.2.  Trust Policy NO-LEARNING

   When enforcing the NO-LEARNING policy, the peer P trusts CRED only if
   P is already storing CRED at message reception time, unless in cases
   where situation-specific exceptions apply and are deliberately
   enforced (see below).

   That is, upon receiving M, the peer P continues the execution of
   EDHOC only if both the following conditions hold.

   *  P currently stores CRED, as specified by reference or by value in
      the ID_CRED_I/ID_CRED_R field of M or in the value of an EAD item
      of M; and

   *  CRED is still valid, i.e., P believes CRED to not be expired or
      revoked.

   Exceptions may apply and be actually enforced in cases where, during
   an EDHOC execution, P obtains additional information that allows it
   to trust and successfully validate CRED, even though CRED is not
   already stored upon receiving M.  Such exceptions typically rely on a
   trusted party that vouches for CRED, such as in the following cases:

   *  In the EDHOC and OSCORE profile of the ACE framework defined in
      [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile], the EDHOC peer acting as ACE
      client C can include an EAD item in an EDHOC message sent to the
      other EDHOC peer acting as ACE resource server (RS).  The EAD item
      transports (a reference to) an access token issued by a trusted
      ACE authorization server (AS).  In turn, the access token
      specifies CRED as the authentication credential of C, by value or
      by reference.  Through a successful verification of the access
      token, the RS is able to trust CRED (if found valid), even if not
      already storing it upon receiving the EDHOC message with the EAD
      item.  This case is further discussed in Section 3.3.1.

   *  In the procedure defined in [I-D.ietf-lake-authz], the EDHOC
      Initiator U receives an EDHOC message_2 where ID_CRED_R specifies
      the authentication credential of the EDHOC Responder V by value.
      In the same EDHOC message_2, an EAD item specifies a voucher
      issued by a trusted enrollment server W, which conveys
      authorization information about V and V's authentication
      credential CRED.  Through a successful verification of the
      voucher, U is able to trust CRED (if found valid), even though it
      did not already store CRED upon receiving EDHOC message_2.  This
      case is further discussed in Section 3.3.2.

   Editor's note: consider moving the content in the two bullet points
   above to the dedicated Section 3.3.1 and Section 3.3.2.

   If the peer P admits such an exception and actually enforces it on an
   authentication credential CRED, then P effectively handles CRED
   according to the trust policy "LEARNING" specified in Section 3.1.

3.3.  Enforcement of Trust Policies in Specific Scenarios

   The following subsections discuss how an EDHOC peer enforces the
   trust policies LEARNING and NO-LEARNING in specific scenarios.

3.3.1.  In the EDHOC and OSCORE Profile of ACE

   As discussed in Section 2.3, two EDHOC peers can be using the ACE
   framework [RFC9200] and specifically the EDHOC and OSCORE profile of
   ACE defined in [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile].

   In this case, one of the two EDHOC peers, namely PEER_RS, acts as ACE
   resource server (RS).  Instead, the other EDHOC peer, namely PEER_C,
   acts as ACE client and obtains from the ACE authorization server (AS)
   an access token for accessing protected resources at PEER_RS.

   Together with other information, the access token specifies (by value
   or by reference) the public authentication credential AUTH_CRED_C
   that PEER_C is going to use when running EDHOC with PEER_RS.  Note
   that AUTH_CRED_C will be used as either CRED_I or CRED_R, depending
   on whether the two peers use the EDHOC forward message flow (i.e.,
   PEER_C is the EDHOC Initiator) or the EDHOC reverse message flow
   (i.e., PEER_C is the EDHOC Responder), respectively (see Appendix A.2
   of [RFC9528]).

   When the AS issues the first access token that specifies AUTH_CRED_C
   and is intended to be uploaded to PEER_RS, it is expected that the
   access token specifies AUTH_CRED_C by value, and that PEER_RS is not
   currently storing AUTH_CRED_C, but instead will obtain it and learn
   it upon receiving the access token.

   Although the AS can upload the access token to PEER_RS on behalf of
   PEER_C as per the alternative workflow defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ace-workflow-and-params], the access token is typically
   uploaded to PEER_RS by PEER_C through a dedicated EAD item, when
   running EDHOC with PEER_RS.  Consequently, PEER_RS has to learn
   AUTH_CRED_C as a new public authentication credential during an EDHOC
   session with PEER_C.

   At least for its EDHOC resource used for exchanging the EDHOC
   messages of the EDHOC session in question, this requires PEER_RS to:

   *  Enforce the trust policy "LEARNING"; or

   *  If enforcing the trust policy "NO-LEARNING", additionally enforce
      an overriding exception when an incoming EDHOC message includes an
      EAD item conveying (a reference to) an access token (see
      Section 3.2).

3.3.2.  In the Ligthweight Authorization using EDHOC (ELA) Procedure

   TBD

4.  Side Processing of Incoming EDHOC Messages

   This section describes an approach that EDHOC peers can use upon
   receiving EDHOC messages, in order to fetch/validate authentication
   credentials and to process External Authorization Data (EAD) items.

   As per Section 9.1 of [RFC9528], the EDHOC protocol provides a
   transport mechanism for conveying EAD items, but specifications
   defining those items have to set the ground for "agreeing on the
   surrounding context and the meaning of the information passed to and
   from the application".

   The approach described in this section aims to help implementors
   navigate the surrounding context mentioned above, irrespective of the
   specific EAD items conveyed in the EDHOC messages.  In particular,
   the described approach takes into account the following points.

   *  The fetching and validation of the other peer's authentication
      credential relies on ID_CRED_I in EDHOC message_2, or on ID_CRED_R
      in EDHOC message_3, or on the value of an EAD item.  When this
      occurs upon receiving EDHOC message_2 or message_3, the decryption
      of the EDHOC message has to be completed first.

      The validation of the other peer's authentication credential might
      depend on using the value of an EAD item, which in turn has to be
      validated first.  For instance, an EAD item within the EAD_2 field
      may contain a voucher to be used for validating the other peer's
      authentication credential (see [I-D.ietf-lake-authz]).

   *  Some EAD items may be processed only after having successfully
      verified the EDHOC message, i.e., after a successful verification
      of the Signature_or_MAC field.

      For instance, an EAD item within the EAD_3 field may contain a
      Certificate Signing Request (CSR) [RFC2986].  Hence, such an EAD
      item can be processed only once the recipient peer has attained
      proof of the other peer possessing its private key.

   In order to conveniently handle such processing, the application can
   prepare in advance a "side-processor object" (SPO), which takes care
   of the operations above during the EDHOC execution.

   In particular, the application provides EDHOC with the SPO before
   starting an EDHOC execution, during which EDHOC will temporarily
   transfer control to the SPO at the right point in time, in order to
   perform the required side-processing of an incoming EDHOC message.

   Furthermore, the application has to instruct the SPO about how to
   prepare any EAD item such that: it has to be included in an outgoing
   EDHOC message; and it is independent of the processing of other EAD
   items included in incoming EDHOC messages.  This includes, for
   instance, the preparation of padding EAD items.

   At the right point in time during the processing of an incoming EDHOC
   message M at the peer P, EDHOC invokes the SPO and provides it with
   the following input:

   *  When M is EDHOC message_2 or message_3, an indication of whether
      this invocation is happening before or after the message
      verification (i.e., before or after having verified the
      Signature_or_MAC field).

   *  The full set of information related to the current EDHOC session.
      This especially includes the selected cipher suite and the
      ephemeral Diffie-Hellman public keys G_X and G_Y that the two
      peers have exchanged in the EDHOC session.

   *  The other peers' authentication credentials that the peer P
      stores.

   *  All the decrypted information elements retrieved from M.

   *  The EAD items included in M.

      -  Note that EDHOC might do some preliminary work on M before
         invoking the SPO, in order to provide the SPO only with
         actually relevant EAD items.  This requires the application to
         additionally provide EDHOC with the ead_labels of the EAD items
         that the peer P recognizes (see Section 3.8 of [RFC9528]).

         With such information available, EDHOC can early abort the
         current session in case M includes any EAD item which is both
         critical and not recognized by the peer P.

         If no such EAD items are found, EDHOC can remove any padding
         EAD item (see Section 3.8.1 of [RFC9528]), as well as any EAD
         item which is neither critical nor recognized (since the SPO is
         going to ignore it anyway).  This results in EDHOC providing
         the SPO only with EAD items that will be recognized and that
         require actual processing.

      -  Note that, after having processed the EAD items, the SPO might
         actually need to store them throughout the whole EDHOC
         execution, e.g., in order to refer to them also when processing
         later EDHOC messages in the current EDHOC session.

   The SPO performs the following tasks on an incoming EDHOC message M.

   *  The SPO fetches and/or validates the other peer's authentication
      credential CRED, based on a dedicated EAD item of M or on the
      ID_CRED field of M (for EDHOC message_2 or message_3).

   *  The SPO processes the EAD items conveyed in the EAD field of M.

   *  The SPO stores the results of the performed operations, and makes
      such results available to the application.

   *  When the SPO has completed its side processing and transfers
      control back to EDHOC, the SPO provides EDHOC with the produced
      EAD items to include in the EAD field of the next outgoing EDHOC
      message.  The production of such EAD items can be triggered, e.g.,
      by:

      -  The consumption of EAD items included in M.

      -  The execution of instructions that the SPO has received from
         the application, concerning EAD items to produce irrespective
         of other EAD items included in M.

   In the following, Section 4.1 to Section 4.3 describe more in detail
   the actions performed by the SPO on the different, incoming EDHOC
   messages.  Then, Section 4.4 describes further, special handling of
   incoming EDHOC messages in particular situations.

   After completing the EDHOC execution, control is transferred back to
   the application.  In particular, the application is provided with the
   overall outcome of the EDHOC execution (i.e., successful completion
   or failure), together with possible specific results produced by the
   SPO throughout the EDHOC execution (e.g., due to the processing of
   EAD items).

   After that, the application might need to perform follow-up actions,
   depending on the outcome of the EDHOC execution.  For example, the
   SPO might have preliminarily filled application-level data
   structures, as a result of processing EAD items.  In case of
   successful EDHOC execution, the application might need to finalize
   such data structures.  Instead, in case of unsuccessful EDHOC
   execution, the application might need to clean-up or amend such data
   structures, or even roll back what the SPO did, unless the SPO
   already performed such actions before control was transferred back to
   the application.

4.1.  EDHOC message_1

   During the processing of an incoming EDHOC message_1, EDHOC invokes
   the SPO only once, after the Responder peer has successfully decoded
   the message and accepted the selected cipher suite.

   If the EAD_1 field is present, the SPO processes the EAD items
   included therein.

   Once all such EAD items have been processed the SPO transfers control
   back to EDHOC.  When doing so, the SPO also provides EDHOC with any
   produced EAD items to include in the EAD field of the next outgoing
   EDHOC message.

   Then, EDHOC resumes its execution and advances its protocol state.

4.2.  EDHOC message_4

   During the processing of an incoming EDHOC message_4, EDHOC invokes
   the SPO only once, after the Initiator peer has successfully
   decrypted the message.

   If the EAD_4 field is present, the SPO processes the EAD items
   included therein.

   Once all such EAD items have been processed, the SPO transfers
   control back to EDHOC, which resumes its execution and advances its
   protocol state.

4.3.  EDHOC message_2 and message_3

   The following refers to "message_X" as an incoming EDHOC message_2 or
   message_3, and to "message verification" as the verification of
   Signature_or_MAC_X in message_X.

   During the processing of a message_X, EDHOC invokes the SPO two
   times:

   *  Right after message_X has been decrypted and before its
      verification starts.  Following this invocation, the SPO performs
      the actions described in Section 4.3.1.

   *  Right after message_X has been successfully verified.  Following
      this invocation, the SPO performs the actions described in
      Section 4.3.2.

   The flowcharts in Section 4.3.3 show the high-level interaction
   between the core EDHOC processing and the SPO, as well as the
   different steps taken for processing an incoming message_X.

4.3.1.  Pre-Verification Side Processing

   The pre-verification side processing occurs in two sequential phases,
   namely PHASE_1 and PHASE_2.

   PHASE_1 - During PHASE_1, the SPO at the recipient peer P determines
   CRED, i.e., the other peer's authentication credential to use in the
   ongoing EDHOC session.  In particular, the SPO performs the following
   steps.

   1.   The SPO determines CRED based on ID_CRED_X or on an EAD item in
        message_X.

        Those may specify CRED by value or by reference, including a URI
        or other external reference where CRED can be retrieved from.

        If CRED is already installed, the SPO moves to Step 2.
        Otherwise, the SPO moves to Step 3.

   2.   The SPO determines if the stored CRED is currently valid, e.g.,
        by asserting that CRED has not expired and has not been revoked.

        Performing such a validation may require the SPO to first
        process an EAD item included in message_X.  For example, it can
        be an EAD item in EDHOC message_2, which confirms or revokes the
        validity of CRED_R specified by ID_CRED_R, as the result of an
        OCSP process [RFC6960].

        In case CRED is determined to be valid, the SPO moves to Step 9.
        Otherwise, the SPO moves to Step 11.

   3.   The SPO attempts to retrieve CRED, and then moves to Step 4.

   4.   If the retrieval of CRED has succeeded, the SPO moves to Step 5.
        Otherwise, the SPO moves to Step 11.

   5.   If the enforced trust policy for new authentication credentials
        is "NO-LEARNING" and P does not admit any exceptions that are
        acceptable to enforce for message_X (see Section 3), the SPO
        moves to Step 11.  Otherwise, the SPO moves to Step 6.

   6.   If this step has been reached, the peer P is not already storing
        the retrieved CRED and, at the same time, it enforces either the
        trust policy "LEARNING" or the trust policy "NO-LEARNING" while
        also enforcing an exception acceptable for message_X (see
        Section 3).

        Consistently, the SPO determines if CRED is currently valid,
        e.g., by asserting that CRED has not expired and has not been
        revoked.  Then, the SPO moves to Step 7.

        Validating CRED may require the SPO to first process an EAD item
        included in message_X.  For example, it can be an EAD item in
        EDHOC message_2 that: i) specifies a voucher for validating
        CRED_R as a CWT Claims Set (CCS) [RFC8392] transported by value
        in ID_CRED_R (see [I-D.ietf-lake-authz]); or instead ii) an OCSP
        response [RFC6960] for validating CRED_R as a certificate
        transported by value or reference in ID_CRED_R.

   7.   If CRED has been determined valid, the SPO moves to Step 8.
        Otherwise, the SPO moves to Step 11.

   8.   The SPO stores CRED as a valid and trusted authentication
        credential associated with the other peer, together with
        corresponding authentication credential identifiers (see
        Section 3).  Then, the SPO moves to Step 9.

   9.   The SPO checks if CRED is fine to use in the context of the
        ongoing EDHOC session, also depending on the specific identity
        of the other peer (see Sections 3.5 and D.2 of [RFC9528]).

        If this is the case, the SPO moves to Step 10.  Otherwise, the
        SPO moves to Step 11.

   10.  P uses CRED as authentication credential of the other peer in
        the ongoing EDHOC session.

        Then, PHASE_1 ends, and the pre-verification side processing
        moves to the next PHASE_2 (see below).

   11.  The SPO has not found a valid authentication credential
        associated with the other peer that can be used in the ongoing
        EDHOC session.  Therefore, the EDHOC session with the other peer
        is aborted.

   PHASE_2 - During PHASE_2, the SPO processes any EAD item included in
   message_X such that both the following conditions hold.

   *  The EAD item has _not_ been already processed during PHASE_1.

   *  The EAD item can be processed before performing the verification
      of message_X.

   Once all such EAD items have been processed, the SPO transfers
   control back to EDHOC, which either aborts the ongoing EDHOC session
   or continues the processing of message_X with its corresponding
   message verification.

4.3.2.  Post-Verification Side Processing

   During the post-verification side processing, the SPO processes any
   EAD item included in message_X such that the processing of that EAD
   item had to wait for completing the successful message verification.

   The late processing of such EAD items is typically due to the fact
   that a pre-requirement has to be fulfilled first.  For example, the
   recipient peer P has to have first asserted that the other peer does
   possess the private key corresponding to the public key of the other
   peer's authentication credential CRED determined during the pre-
   verification side processing (see Section 4.3.1).  This requirement
   is fulfilled after a successful message verification of message_X.

   Once all such EAD items have been processed, the SPO transfers
   control back to EDHOC.  When doing so, the SPO also provides EDHOC
   with any produced EAD items to include in the EAD field of the next
   outgoing EDHOC message.

   Then, EDHOC resumes its execution and advances its protocol state.

4.3.3.  Flowcharts

4.4.  Special Cases of Message Handling

   This section describes methods to perform special handling of
   incoming EDHOC messages in particular situations.

4.4.1.  Consistency Checks of Authentication Credentials from ID_CRED
        and EAD Items

   Typically, an EDHOC peer specifies its authentication credential (by
   value or by reference) only in the ID_CRED field of EDHOC message_2
   (if acting as Responder) or EDHOC message_3 (if acting as Initiator).

   There may be cases where, in addition to that, an EDHOC peer provides
   its authentication credential also in an EAD item.  In particular,
   such an EAD item can specify an "envelope" (by value or by
   reference), which in turn specifies the peer's authentication
   credential (by value or by reference).

   A case in point is the EDHOC and OSCORE profile of the ACE framework
   [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile], where the envelope in question
   is an access token issued to the ACE client.  In such a case, the ACE
   client can rely on an EAD item specifying the access token by value,
   or instead on a different EAD item specifying a session identifier as
   a reference to such access token.  In either case, the access token
   specifies the client's authentication credential (by value or by
   reference).

   During an EDHOC session, an EDHOC peer P1 might therefore receive the
   authentication credential of the other EDHOC peer P2 as specified by
   two items:

   *  ITEM_A: the ID_CRED field specifying P2's authentication
      credential.  If P2 acts as Initiator (Responder), then ITEM_A is
      the ID_CRED_I (ID_CRED_R) field.

   *  ITEM_B: the envelope specified in an EAD item, within an EDHOC
      message sent by P2.

   As part of the process where P1 validates P2's authentication
   credential during the EDHOC session, P1 must check that both ITEM_A
   and ITEM_B specify the same authentication credential, and abort the
   EDHOC session in case such a consistency check fails.

   The consistency check is successful only if one of the following
   conditions hold, and it fails otherwise.

   *  If both ITEM_A and ITEM_B specify an authentication credential by
      value, then both ITEM_A and ITEM_B specify the same value.

   *  If one among ITEM_A and ITEM_B specifies an authentication
      credential by value VALUE while the other one specifies an
      authentication credential by reference REF, then REF is a valid
      reference for VALUE.

   *  If ITEM_A specifies an authentication credential by reference
      REF_A and ITEM_B specifies an authentication credential by
      reference REF_B, then REF_A or REF_B allows to retrieving the
      value VALUE of an authentication credential from a local or remote
      storage, such that both REF_A and REF_B are a valid reference for
      VALUE.

   The peer P1 performs the consistency check above as soon as it has
   both ITEM_A and ITEM_B available.  If P1 acts as Responder, that is
   the case when processing the incoming EDHOC message_3.  If P1 acts as
   Initiator, that is the case when processing the incoming EDHOC
   message_2 or message_4, i.e., whichever of the two messages includes
   ITEM_B in an EAD item of its EAD field.

5.  Using EDHOC over CoAP with Block-Wise

   Appendix A.2 of [RFC9528] specifies how to transfer EDHOC over CoAP
   [RFC7252].  In such a case, the EDHOC messages (possibly prepended by
   an EDHOC connection identifier) are transported in the payload of
   CoAP requests and responses, according to the EDHOC forward message
   flow or the EDHOC reverse message flow.  Furthermore, Appendix A.1 of
   [RFC9528] specifies how to derive an OSCORE Security Context
   [RFC8613] from an EDHOC session.

   Building on that, [RFC9668] further details the use of EDHOC with
   CoAP and OSCORE, and specifies an optimization approach for the EDHOC
   forward message flow that combines the EDHOC execution with the first
   subsequent OSCORE transaction.  This is achieved by means of an
   "EDHOC + OSCORE request", i.e., a single CoAP request message that
   conveys both EDHOC message_3 of the ongoing EDHOC session and the
   OSCORE-protected application data, where the latter is protected with
   the OSCORE Security Context derived from that EDHOC session.

   This section provides guidelines and recommendations for CoAP
   endpoints supporting Block-wise transfers for CoAP [RFC7959] and
   specifically for CoAP clients supporting the EDHOC + OSCORE request
   defined in [RFC9668].  The use of Block-wise transfers can be
   desirable, e.g., for EDHOC messages that include a large ID_CRED_I or
   ID_CRED_R, or that include a large EAD field.

   The following especially considers a CoAP endpoint that may perform
   only "inner" Block-wise, but not "outer" Block-wise operations (see
   Section 4.1.3.4 of [RFC8613]).  That is, the considered CoAP endpoint
   does not (further) split an OSCORE-protected message like an
   intermediary (e.g., a proxy) might do.  This is the typical case for
   CoAP endpoints using OSCORE (see Section 4.1.3.4 of [RFC8613]).

5.1.  Notation

   The rest of this section refers to the following notation.

   *  SIZE_BODY: the size in bytes of the data to be transmitted with
      CoAP.  When Block-wise is used, such data is referred to as the
      "body" to be fragmented into blocks, each of which to be
      transmitted in one CoAP message.

      With the exception of EDHOC message_3, the considered body can
      also be an EDHOC message, possibly prepended by an EDHOC
      connection identifier encoded as per Section 3.3 of [RFC9528].

      When specifically using the EDHOC + OSCORE request, the considered
      body is the application data to be protected with OSCORE, (whose
      first block is) to be sent together with EDHOC message_3 as part
      of the EDHOC + OSCORE request.

   *  SIZE_EDHOC_M3: the size in bytes of EDHOC message_3, if this is
      sent as part of the EDHOC + OSCORE request.  Otherwise, the size
      in bytes of EDHOC message_3, plus, if included, the size in bytes
      of a prepended EDHOC connection identifier encoded as per
      Section 3.3 of [RFC9528].

   *  SIZE_MTU: the maximum amount of transmittable bytes before having
      to use Block-wise.  This is, for example, 64 KiB as maximum
      datagram size when using UDP, or 1280 bytes as the maximum size
      for an IPv6 MTU.

   *  SIZE_OH: the size in bytes of the overall overhead due to all the
      communication layers underlying the application.  This takes into
      account also the overhead introduced by the OSCORE processing.

   *  LIMIT = (SIZE_MTU - SIZE_OH): the practical maximum size in bytes
      to be considered by the application before using Block-wise.

   *  SIZE_BLOCK: the size in bytes of inner blocks.

   *  ceil(): the ceiling function.

5.2.  Pre-requirements for the EDHOC + OSCORE Request

   Before sending an EDHOC + OSCORE request, a CoAP client has to
   perform the following checks.  Note that, while the CoAP client is
   able to fragment the plain application data before any OSCORE
   processing, it cannot fragment the EDHOC + OSCORE request or the
   EDHOC message_3 added therein.

   *  If inner Block-wise is not used, hence SIZE_BODY <= LIMIT, the
      CoAP client must verify whether all the following conditions hold:

      -  COND1: SIZE_EDHOC_M3 <= LIMIT

      -  COND2: (SIZE_BODY + SIZE_EDHOC_M3) <= LIMIT

   *  If inner Block-wise is used, the CoAP client must verify whether
      all the following conditions hold:

      -  COND3: SIZE_EDHOC_M3 <= LIMIT

      -  COND4: (SIZE_BLOCK + SIZE_EDHOC_M3) <= LIMIT

   In either case, if not all the corresponding conditions hold, the
   CoAP client should not send the EDHOC + OSCORE request.  Instead, the
   CoAP client can continue by switching to the purely sequential,
   original EDHOC workflow (see Appendix A.2.1 of [RFC9528]).  That is,
   the CoAP client first sends EDHOC message_3 prepended by the EDHOC
   Connection Identifier C_R encoded as per Section 3.3 of [RFC9528],
   and then sends the OSCORE-protected CoAP request once the EDHOC
   execution is completed.

5.3.  Effectively Using Block-Wise

   In order to avoid further fragmentation at lower layers when sending
   an EDHOC + OSCORE request, the CoAP client has to use inner Block-
   wise if _any_ of the following conditions holds:

   *  COND5: SIZE_BODY > LIMIT

   *  COND6: (SIZE_BODY + SIZE_EDHOC_M3) > LIMIT

   In particular, consistently with Section 5.2, the used SIZE_BLOCK has
   to be such that the following condition also holds:

   *  COND7: (SIZE_BLOCK + SIZE_EDHOC_M3) <= LIMIT

   Note that the CoAP client might still use Block-wise due to reasons
   different from exceeding the size indicated by LIMIT.

   The following shows the number of round trips for completing both the
   EDHOC execution and the first OSCORE-protected exchange, under the
   assumption that the exchange of EDHOC message_1 and EDHOC message_2
   do not result in using Block-wise.

   If _both_ the conditions COND5 and COND6 hold, the use of Block-wise
   results in the following number of round trips experienced by the
   CoAP client.

   *  If the original EDHOC execution workflow is used (see
      Appendix A.2.1 of [RFC9528]), the number of round trips RT_ORIG is
      equal to 1 + ceil(SIZE_EDHOC_M3 / SIZE_BLOCK) + ceil(SIZE_BODY /
      SIZE_BLOCK).

   *  If the optimized EDHOC execution workflow is used (see Section 3
      of [RFC9668]), the number of round trips RT_COMB is equal to 1 +
      ceil(SIZE_BODY / SIZE_BLOCK).

   It follows that RT_COMB < RT_ORIG, i.e., the optimized EDHOC
   execution workflow always yields a lower number of round trips.

   Instead, the convenience of using the optimized EDHOC execution
   workflow becomes questionable if _both_ the following conditions
   hold:

   *  COND8: SIZE_BODY <= LIMIT

   *  COND9: (SIZE_BODY + SIZE_EDHOC_M3) > LIMIT

   That is, since SIZE_BODY <= LIMIT, using Block-wise would not be
   required when using the original EDHOC execution workflow, provided
   that SIZE_EDHOC_M3 <= LIMIT still holds.

   At the same time, using the combined workflow is in itself what
   actually triggers the use of Block-wise, since (SIZE_BODY +
   SIZE_EDHOC_M3) > LIMIT.

   Therefore, the following round trips are experienced by the CoAP
   client.

   *  The original EDHOC execution workflow run without using Block-wise
      results in a number of round trips RT_ORIG equal to 3.

   *  The optimized EDHOC execution workflow run using Block-wise
      results in a number of round trips RT_COMB equal to 1 +
      ceil(SIZE_BODY / SIZE_BLOCK).

   It follows that RT_COMB >= RT_ORIG, i.e., the optimized EDHOC
   execution workflow might still be not worse than the original EDHOC
   execution workflow in terms of round trips.  This is the case only if
   the used SIZE_BLOCK is such that ceil(SIZE_BODY / SIZE_BLOCK) is
   equal to 2, i.e., the plain application data is fragmented into only
   2 inner blocks, and thus the EDHOC + OSCORE request is followed by
   only one more request message transporting the last block of the
   body.

   However, even in such a case, there would be no advantage in terms or
   round trips compared to the original workflow, while still requiring
   the CoAP client and the CoAP server to perform the processing due to
   using the EDHOC + OSCORE request and Block-wise transferring.

   Therefore, if both the conditions COND8 and COND9 hold, the CoAP
   client should not send the EDHOC + OSCORE request.  Instead, the CoAP
   client should continue by switching to the original EDHOC execution
   workflow.  That is, the CoAP client first sends EDHOC message_3
   prepended by the EDHOC Connection Identifier C_R encoded as per
   Section 3.3 of [RFC9528], and then sends the OSCORE-protected CoAP
   request once the EDHOC execution is completed.
